						What are external plugins?
					</div>
					<p>
						These are unofficial, external plugins for the OpenOSRS old school runescape client 
					</p>
					<p>
						Plugins can assist the user by being small helpers for tedious tasks or they can fully automate something.
					</p>

					<div className={classes(css.faqTitle)}>
						Where do I get the free plugins?
					</div>
					<p>

						Can I get banned?
					</div>
					<p>
						The game rules forbid software from inputting more than 1 input per 1 user input. This essentially means that
						the plugins you find here are not allowed by game rules and usage may result in your account getting banned.
